In this project, a map page was created using Google Maps API. The map page is created as a fragment and called through the main activity.

When we first open the application, the application asks us for permission to access location.

There is a search bar integrated with Google Places at the top of the map.

When we press on any address, a toast message appears showing the address we selected. There is a camera code that allows us to go to the location we choose, but sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. Also due to communication problems between fragment and activity.
